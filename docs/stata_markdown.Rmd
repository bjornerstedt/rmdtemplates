```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment="")
library(knitr)
```


The file setup.Rmd contains the code from 
[this page](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~hemken/Stataworkshops/Stata%20and%20R%20Markdown/StataProfile.html).
It configures Rmarkdown to use Stata, and puts the collectcode chunk in profile.do, to be run for each chunk.
Opening a dta file is an example of usage. 

Note that:
- The path to Stata has to be set on your computer

```{r child = 'setup.Rmd'}
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document illustrating that many languages can be used in the same document.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Include Stata

Here are some summary statistics for the system Stata dataset `lifeexp.dta`

```{stata, collectcode=TRUE}
sysuse lifeexp
summarize
```

Each chunk has to be self-contained.

```{stata}
sum popgrowth lexp
```
