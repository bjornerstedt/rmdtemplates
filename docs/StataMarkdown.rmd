## Introduction
This is an introduction to writing dynamic documents
using R Markdown to produce
documents based on Stata.  This process uses 
Rstudio (or just R) to create documents that depend upon Stata code.
The source for **this** document is [StataMarkdown.rmd](StataMarkdown.rmd)

## Background
*Markdown* is a language for formatting not-too-complicated documents using 
just a few text symbols.  It is designed to be easy to read and write. 
If you read and write email, you are probably already familiar with many
of these formatting conventions.
For more specifics about Markdown see John Gruber\'s
[Markdown article](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). 

Dynamic Markdown has been implemented for a number of programming languages,
including Stata and R.  Within Stata there are versions of dynamic
markdown that rely on Stata\'s `dyndoc` command, as well as
user-written packages such as `markstat`, `markdoc`, and `webdoc`.  Each
has it\'s strengths and weaknesses (which I review elsewhere).  One
of these may appeal to you - the system I will describe here is
intended primarily for those of us who are using R Markdown to
write documentation in other languages, and would like to use this
for Stata as well (rather than learn a new set of formatting conventions
and a new user interface).

*R Markdown* is a dynamic markdown system that
extends Markdown by allowing you to include blocks of code in one
of several programming languages.  The code is evaluated, and both the
code and it\'s results are included in a Markdown document.  To read
more about the details of R Markdown see RStudio\'s 
[R Markdown webpages](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)

*RStudio* uses an R package called `knitr` (this could also be called
directly from R), which includes the ability to evaluate Stata
(please be sure you are using an up-to-date version
of `knitr`).

The documentation for `knitr` can be found in R\'s Help, from 
[this web page](https://yihui.name/knitr/), or in Yihui Xie\'s book,
*Dynamic Documents with R and Knitr*.

Finally, I make use of some helper functions in a package called
`Statamarkdown`.  While these are not necessary to write dynamic
documents based on Stata, they make life easier.

`Statamarkdown` can be installed from github.com.
```
library(devtools) # you may need to install devtools
install_github(hemken/Statamarkdown)
```

Note, RStudio is a great environment for writing Markdown with
executable R code chunks, but it is 
not a friendly environment for extensively
debugging problems in your Stata code.  If your Stata code
is complicated, you should probably work out the details
in Stata first, then pull it into RStudio to develop
your documentation!

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
  backtick <- "`"
  library(Statamarkdown)
  stataexe <- find_stata()
  knitr::opts_chunk$set(engine.path=stataexe)
```

## Setting up the Stata engine
In order to execute your Stata code, `knitr` needs to know where the Stata
executable is located.  It may also be convenient to specify that all code
will be executed using Stata, and that the output should be displayed
without adornment.  All of this can be done with a preliminary code chunk,
by loading the Statamarkdown package, and specifying options:

    `r backtick```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
    library(Statamarkdown)
    stataexe <- find_stata()
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(engine.path=stataexe)
    `r backtick```
  
(In `knitr` jargon, a block of code is a \"code chunk\".)  

If the package fails to find your copy of Stata (you will see a message),
you may have to
specify this yourself (see [Stata Engine Path](StataEnginePath.html)).

    `r backtick```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
    library(Statamarkdown)
    stataexe <- "C:/Program Files (x86)/Stata14/StataSE-64.exe"
    opts_chunk$set(engine.path=stataexe)
    `r backtick```

After this setup chunk, subsequent code to be processed by Stata 
can be specified as:

    `r backtick```{stata}
    
    -- Stata code here --
    
    `r backtick```

## Linking Code Blocks (collectcode=TRUE)
Each block (chunk) of Stata code is executed as a ***separate*** batch job.
This means that as you move from code chunk to code chunk, all your previous
work is lost.
To retain data from code chunk to code chunk requires collecting (some
of) your code and processing it silently at the beginning of each
subsequent chunk.  

You can have knitr collect code for you, as outlined in 
[*Linking Stata Code Blocks*](StataProfile.html).

## Hints and Examples
Stata does not give you fine control over what ends
up in the .log file.  Coming up with some sort of
`knitr` post-processing (as an \"output hook\", 
see [*Stata Output Hooks*](StataOutputHooks.html)) may be worthwhile.
What I present here is pretty basic.

It would be typical style to show just the Stata
log (output), and not have a separate code block, since
the code is always echoed in the log.  The approach I
use later in these web notes is to clean the source code
from the output using output hooks, then show the code
and the cleaned output.

Including graphics requires `graph export` in Stata, and an
image link in the R Markdown.  The `knitr` chunk option `echo` 
can print just specified
lines of code, allowing you to hide the `graph export`
command.

### Descriptive Statistics
A simple example.
```{stata, collectcode=TRUE}
sysuse auto
summarize
```

### Frequency Tables
Using chunk option `echo=FALSE`, more typical Stata
documentation style.
```{stata, echo=FALSE}
tab1 foreign rep78
```

### T-tests
Another very simple example.
```{stata}
ttest mpg, by(foreign)
```

### Graphics
The example uses the knitr chunk options `results="hide"` to
suppress the log and `echo=1` to hide
the Stata `graph export` command that users do not need to see.
```{stata, echo=1, results="hide"}
graph box mpg, over(foreign)
graph export "boxplot.png", replace
```
