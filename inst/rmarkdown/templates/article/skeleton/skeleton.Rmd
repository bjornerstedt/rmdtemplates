# Citations

Here is a citation @fenner2012a.

Blah blah [see @fenner2012a, pp. 33-35; also @fenner2012b, ch. 1].

Blah blah [@fenner2012a, pp. 33-35, 38-39 and *passim*].

Blah blah [@fenner2012a; @fenner2012b].
A minus sign (-) before the @ will suppress mention of the author in the citation. This can be useful when the author is already mentioned in the text:

Bj√∂rnerstedt says blah [-@fenner2012a].

You can also write an in-text citation, as follows:

@fenner2012a says blah.

@fenner2012a [p. 33] says blah.

To include an entry with name `citekey` in the bibliography without citing, put the following code in the introduction:

```
nocite: | 
  @citekey
```

# Cross references {#intro}

Cross references are defined by `(\#name)` and invoked by `\@ref(name)`, where `name` can be the label of an equation, table, figure or section. The name consists of two parts, separated by a colon, for example `tab:tabname`, `eq:eqname`.

- For sections `# Cross references {#intro}` in the section title can be referenced as section \@ref(intro)
- For chunks with plots, and chunks with tables generated with the `kable()` command, the label is the chunk name.

# Figures

Here is the code to label a figure and add a caption text. Using the following syntax full formatting is possible, 

```{r cool-plot, fig.cap='A boxplot of the data iris in base R'}
boxplot(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)
```

A reference to the figure: Figure \@ref(fig:cool-plot)

# Equations

Numbered equations are enclosed in a `\begin{equation} ... \end{equation}` block.

\begin{equation}
  E=mc^2(\#eq:emc)
\end{equation}

Here is a reference to equation \@ref(eq:emc). 

# Tables

A table generated by R, with floating placement. Use the [kableExtra package](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/) to get fixed placement

```{r mtcars}
knitr::kable(
  head(mtcars[, 1:8], 5), booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'A table of the first 5 rows of the mtcars data.'
)
```

See Table \@ref(tab:mtcars), placed somewhere in the text

Here is a table in markdown, with fixed placement. Note that the first paragraph specifies the text, followed by the table itself in the next paragraph.

Table: (\#tab:sepal) A simple table in Markdown

 Sepal.Length   Sepal.Width   Petal.Length   Petal.Width
-------------  ------------  -------------  ------------
          5.1           3.5            1.4           0.2
          4.9           3.0            1.4           0.2
          4.7           3.2            1.3           0.2

Here is a reference to Table \@ref(tab:sepal).
